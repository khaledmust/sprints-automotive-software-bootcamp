# By how much, is it over/under budget?
- Planned value until this moment is $2400K.
- Actual value until this moment is $2700K
- Therefore Planned value - Actual value = 2400 - 2700 = -300
    So we are overbudget by $300K

# By how many days, is it ahead/behind the schedule?
Since the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) of the project is 1 then we are on shcedule.

# By the end of the project, by how much will it be over/under the budget?
- Budget - EAC = 3700 - 4200 = -500
So we are over budget by around $500K.
